Code to analyze radio sources

## Key terms

**components**: little point-like portions of flux. Extended source models can be built using many point-like flux components. <br />

**declination**: a celestial (and therefore spherical) coordinate that descibes locations on the sky. Declination traces an arc from the North Celestial pole (+90 degrees) to the South Celestial pole (-90 degrees), or "up" to "down".<br />

**field of view**: the range in area of the sky that the instrument can see clearly. <br />

**fits files**: Flexible Image Transport System. <br />

**flux density**: the energy absorbed per unit area per unit time. <br />

**galactic diffuse emission**: electrons stuck in the magnetic field of the galaxy emit in the radio. This is bright and large. <br />

**observations**: two minutes worth of data collection. <br />

**right ascension**: a celestial (and therefore spherical) coordinate that descibes locations on the sky. Right ascenion traces an arc around the globe along the equator from 0 to 360 degrees, or "left" to "right".<br />
