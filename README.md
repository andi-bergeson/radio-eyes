# radio-eyes
Code to analyze radio sources

## Key terms

**components**: little point-like portions of flux. Extended source models can be built using many point-like flux components. <br />

**declination**: a celestial (and therefore spherical) coordinate that descibes locations on the sky. Declination traces an arc from the North Celestial pole (+90 degrees) to the South Celestial pole (-90 degrees), or "up" to "down".<br />

**hdu**: Header Data Unit in a fits file <br />

**field of view**: the range in area of the sky that the instrument can see clearly. <br />

**fits files**: Flexible Image Transport System. <br />

**flux density**: the energy absorbed per unit area per unit time. <br />

**galactic diffuse emission**: electrons stuck in the magnetic field of the galaxy emit in the radio. This is bright and large. <br />

**observations**: two minutes worth of data collection. <br />

**right ascension**: a celestial (and therefore spherical) coordinate that descibes locations on the sky. Right ascenion traces an arc around the globe along the equator from 0 to 360 degrees, or "left" to "right".<br />

## Quick github tutorial

**pull** <br />
First, make sure you are fully up-to-date before you push any changes. Run this command in the radio-eyes directory. <br />
`git pull` <br />

**add** <br />
Add the file that you have changed to the local repository. <br />
`git add filename.py` <br />

**commit** <br />
Commit the file you have added to prepare for pushing to the remote repository. Add a little comment that describes the change. <br />
`git commit -m 'Comment'` <br />

**push** <br />
